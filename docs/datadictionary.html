<h1>Data Dictionary - (MongoDB Collections)<a class="headerlink" href="#data-dictionary-mongodb-collections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A collection was created to store the raw data from the Twitter json files and multiple collections were created to store cleaned and transformed data to facilitate the analysis process. Some of the collections share similar fields, which was designed that way to make queries easier and faster to run. Having collections with a focused purpose is also helpful in case other visualization tools are intended to be used in MongoDB. Having all data with all fields in one collection is helpful for cases where there is a need to deal with the unstructured nature of Twitter data, but having separate collections helps with the organization of the data in a more simple way to understand and aggregate the content. That is why a combination of the two approaches was used in this work.</p>
<div class="section" id="main">
<h2>Main<a class="headerlink" href="#main" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are the main collections in charge or saving and processing the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>tweet:</strong> This collection will contain the full raw twitter data. The fields available will depend on the content of the json files. This collection might contain different structure depending on which Twitter api was used to retrieve the data. A few additional fields were created to this collection to keep track of what file the tweet came from, the load timestamp, and to facilitate the recovery process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>focusedTweet:</strong> This collection will contain only the most important information about the tweet. The definition of “interesting” can be different depending on what is being studied, so settings can be updated to drive what fields are interesting.  Some core fields will always be available no matter the settings. It is useful to have a separate collection for two main reasons, the first one is that it decreases the amount of data stored in one collection which increases the queries performance. The second reason is that it makes it possible to have core columns with a standard name without needing to add logic to the program when accessing the data. For example, depending on the Twitter input data, the field that contains the tweet message can have different names, so standardizing that name in the collection makes future processing easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Core Fields:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>id_str:</em> The tweet unique id. This will be a key field that will be used to connect other collections together.</p></li>
<li><p><em>text:</em> The tweet text.</p></li>
<li><p><em>text_lower:</em> The tweet text with all lower case.</p></li>
<li><p><em>quote_text:</em> The text of the quoted tweet, in case there is a quote associated to the tweet.</p></li>
<li><p><em>retweeted_text:</em> The original tweet text in case of retweets.</p></li>
<li><p><em>text_combined:</em> Tweet text combining the tweet text, original text, and quoted text.</p></li>
<li><p><em>text_combined_clean:</em> Same as text_combined, but after going through a series of cleaning steps that will explain in subsection […].</p></li>
<li><p><em>year:</em> The year the tweet was created.</p></li>
<li><p><em>month_name:</em> The name of the month that the tweet was created.</p></li>
<li><p><em>month_no:</em> The month the tweet was created.</p></li>

<li><p><em>user_id:</em> The user id of the user that created the tweet.</p></li>
<li><p><em>hashtags:</em> A list of all hashtags that were included in the tweet, and quoted tweet.</p></li>
<li><p><em>created_at:</em> The timestamp the tweet was created.</p></li>
<li><p><em>lang:</em> The language used in the tweet text.</p></li>
<li><p><em>in_reply_to_status_id_str:</em> In case of replies, this field will show the id of the tweet that the person was replying to.</p></li>
<li><p><em>in_reply_to_screen_name:</em> In case of replies, this field will show the screen name of the user of the tweet that the person was replying to.</p></li>
<li><p><em>user_name:</em> The user name of the person that created the tweet.</p></li>
<li><p><em>user_screen_name:</em> The screen name of the person that created the tweet.</p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p><strong>Added Fields</strong>:</p></li>
<li><p><em>seq_no:</em> Field created to uniquely identify each of the tweets. This field is used in the recovery process to identify the tweets that have already been processed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>is_bot:</em> Identifies if the user that created the tweet is a bot or not. This field is not automatically calculated. A text file with the list of ids that are bots can be used to update this field.</p></li>
<li><p><em>is_bot_connection:</em> Identifies if the tweet is part of an edge between users that are bots. For example, this will be set to 1 if the tweet was a reply or a retweet to a user that is a bot. This field is not automatically calculated.

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>tweetWords:</strong> This collection will save each word separately for every tweet and some additional information about the tweet. It will also contain interesting tags about that word. (e.g English or not, verb or not, etc.)</p>

<li><p><em>is_bot_connection:</em> Same as in the focusedTweet collection.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>tweetConnections:</strong> This collection will contain the edges that connect two tweets together, either by retweets, quotes, replies, or mentions. It will have information about the tweet where the connection happened, and about the two users that connected. This collection will later be used to build the edges for the graph analysis.</p>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>tweetHTConnections:</strong> This collection will contain the edges that connect two hashtags together. If two hashtags were used in the same tweet, a record will be created in this collection. It will have information about the tweet where the connection happened, and about the two hashtags. This collection will later be used to build the edges for the graph analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">

<li><p><strong>users:</strong> This collection will contain interesting information about the tweet user. Some core fields will always exist, but similar to the <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>focusedTweet collection, settings will be available in the pipeline to drive what fields are considered interesting. The same user can appear multiple times in a dataset with different values, for example, the same user can exist with two separate descriptions. This collection will not create multiple records for the same user and it will have the first values found for each user, other records for the same user will be ignored.</p>

<li><p><em>user_type:</em> The method used to extract the information about this user. Twitter’s documents have user information in the main document, but also under the information about the original tweet in case of retweets and quotes. This field will identify where the user was extracted from. The values available will be <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>tweet, <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">*</span></a>retweet, <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">*</span></a>quote, <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">*</span></a>reply, and <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">*</span></a>mention.</p></li>

<p>The following are the administrative collections created to control the recovery process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>adm_loadStatus</strong>: This collection will save the status of each collection’s load and how many tweets have already been inserted in each of them. In case of a failure, it will be used to know which records have already been inserted and which ones haven’t. This was created as part of the recovery process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>adm_loadedFiles:</strong> This collection will save the directory and file names that have already been loaded. The load timestamp and the path will be the columns available.

<p>The following is the collection used to keep all the searches done to the Twitter APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>searches:</strong> This collection will save all the searches done to the Twitter APIs. The fields in this collection will not always be the same.
